					<h1 class="">Djakovo</h1>
					<p class="lead text-center text-md-center">is a small town in the eastern Croatia in the heart of the region of Slavonia. Djakovo is the centre of the fertile and rich Djakovo region. The etymology of the name is the Greek: διάκος (diákos) in Slavic form djak (pupil). The Hungarian diák word has the same Greek origin and as such it's uncertain whether the name came directly from Greek or via Hungarian or local Slavic form.</p>

					<h1 class="">History</h1>
					<p class="lead text-center text-md-center">In Roman antiquity the settlement Certissia stood on the same spot until it disappeared during the Migration Period. The settlement's first mention in historical documents dates from 1239 when Béla IV of Hungary granted it to the Diocese of Bosnia, and the Bishop moved his seat here in 1246. The predecessor to the newer St. Peter's Cathedral was built in 1355. In 1374 the settlement is documented under the name Dyacou. Croatian rebels in 1386 on 25 July captured Queen Mary of Hungary and her mother Elizabeth near the settlement.</p>

					<p class="lead text-center text-md-center">The Ottoman rule over Djakovo started in 1536 and lasted for nearly 150 years. It was a kaza administrative center in Sanjak of Pojega and was known as "Yakova" during this period. In 1805 a Lipizzan horse herd was evacuated to Djakovo when Napoleon invaded Austria & Hungary and a part of the herd remained permanently there. In a 1910 census the settlement's total population of 6304 was made of 4894 Croatians, 890 Germans, 249 Hungarians and 164 Serbians. In the late 19th and early 20th century the settlement was a district capital in the Virovitica County of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia within the Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen. From 1 December 1941 until 7 July 1942 the Ustaše established and operated the Djakovo concentration camp, mostly for Jewish, Roma and Serb women and children.</p>

					<p class="lead text-center text-md-center">The Cathedral basilica of St. Peter in Djakovo is the town's most famous landmark and the most important sacral object, not only in Djakovo but also throughout the whole region of Slavonia. The Cathedral was built 1866-1882 under Josip Juraj Strossmayer, then the Catholic bishop of Djakovo and Srijem. The landscaped park from the 19th century near the bishop's palace is a horticultural monument under special protection as well as the nearby Small Park (Mali Park) dating from the turn of the 19th/20th century.</p>
					<p class="lead text-center">The central traditional event is called Djakovacki vezovi (Djakovo Embroidery). It is a folklore show of the regions Slavonia and Baranja that is organized yearly in the beginning of July, and it presents traditional folk costumes, folklore dancing and singing groups, customs. The Cathedral hosts choirs, opera artists, and art exhibitions are organized in the exhibition salon. The horse and wedding wagon show is a special part of the program. During the sports program, pure-bred white Lipizzaner horses can be seen on the racecourse. They come from the horse-breeding centre in Ivandvor, which has been breeding horses ever since 1506.</p>
